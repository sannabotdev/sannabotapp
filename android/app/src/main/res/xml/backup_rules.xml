  Google Auto Backup rules for SannaBot.

  Strategy:
  - EXCLUDE all sensitive credential/keychain data (API keys, OAuth tokens).
  - INCLUDE only dynamically uploaded skill content from AsyncStorage.
    AsyncStorage on Android stores its data in SharedPreferences under the
    key "RCTAsyncLocalStorage_V1" (React Native ≥ 0.59) or in a database.
    All dynamic skill keys follow the prefix "dynamic_skill_" so they are
    easy to identify.

  Note: react-native-keychain stores credentials in the Android Keystore –
  those are hardware-bound and NOT included in any file backup automatically.
  The excludes below are belt-and-suspenders for older/alternative keychain
  implementations.
-->
<full-backup-content>

  <!-- Exclude sensitive keychain / credential files -->
  <exclude domain="sharedpref" path="react-native-keychain.xml"/>
  <exclude domain="sharedpref" path="com.facebook.react.modules.storage.ReactDatabaseSupplier.xml"/>

  <!-- Include ONLY the AsyncStorage shared-preferences file.
       Android's selective backup supports wildcard key matching only in
       Cloud Backup (dataExtractionRules), not in full-backup-content.
       We therefore include the whole AsyncStorage file – the sensitive
       preferences (API keys etc.) are stored in Keychain, NOT in
       AsyncStorage, so this is safe. -->
  <include domain="sharedpref" path="RCTAsyncLocalStorage_V1.xml"/>
