  Google Auto Backup rules for SannaBot.

  Strategy:
  - EXCLUDE all sensitive credential/keychain data (API keys, OAuth tokens).
  - INCLUDE only dynamically uploaded skill content from AsyncStorage.
    AsyncStorage on Android stores its data in SharedPreferences under the
    key "RCTAsyncLocalStorage_V1" (React Native ≥ 0.59) or in a database.
    All dynamic skill keys follow the prefix "dynamic_skill_" so they are
    easy to identify.

  Note: react-native-keychain stores credentials in the Android Keystore –
  those are hardware-bound and NOT included in any file backup automatically.
  The excludes below are belt-and-suspenders for older/alternative keychain
  implementations.

<full-backup-content>

  <!-- Include ONLY the AsyncStorage shared-preferences file.
       Android's selective backup supports wildcard key matching only in
       Cloud Backup (dataExtractionRules), not in full-backup-content.
       We therefore include the whole AsyncStorage file – the sensitive
       preferences (API keys etc.) are stored in Keychain, NOT in
       AsyncStorage, so this is safe.

       Note: When <include> rules are present, only the listed paths are
       backed up.  All other shared-prefs files (react-native-keychain,
       ReactDatabaseSupplier, etc.) are implicitly excluded, so explicit
       <exclude> entries are unnecessary and would trigger a
       FullBackupContent lint error. -->
